# Random Color Generator
### A Website that quickly lets you generate random colors!

## How to download and use this tool
### There is a live demo over at https://jakobradunski.github.io.
- Scroll down and click on the "Live Demo" button!
- Enjoy!

### Or you can download this repository
- Download the [repository](https://github.com/jakobradunski/Random-Color-Generator-Website/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), or clone it via git / gh...
- Extract the files to a folder of your choosing (via WinRAR / 7-zip, or any other software that lets you do so)
- Open the folder you just extracted these files to, navigate to the folder "src", then open the "index.html" file. It should open the browser by default.
Have fun!

## Usage on the website itself
### On Desktop
Press spacebar or click on the button in the middle (which reads "Press Spacebar"), to generate and display a brand new color! You can click the hex color text to copy the current color to your clipboard.

### On Mobile
Tap on your screen to generate a new color! In my testing environment I've been unable to copy text to the Android clipboard. That feature may require a https secure connection. I'm unsure for now.
