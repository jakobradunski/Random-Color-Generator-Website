Today I found out that CSS elements with that contain negative values in z-index,
for example "z-index: -1", are ignored by javascript event listeners.

That means...
I was finally able to properly implement the "photosensitive epilepsy" warning!
It shows up on startup, and you can either ignore it by clicking around the warning box, dismissing it, or pressing space.
If you don't want it to show up again, just check the "Do not show again" checkbox and it won't show up again,
unless you manually delete localStorage.

For any developers, if you'd like to delete the setting, please use "localStorage.clear();" in the browser console.
It will revert the settings and show the epilepsy warning again. 
Please don't use it on any other site if you don't want your localStorage information to be removed on that site!
