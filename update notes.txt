CSS Responsive Design known issues:
-   Generally the responsive design needs some polish.
-   Because of a media query intended for mobile devices, at a 2 by 1 aspect ratio,
    it will change the layout. I'm fixing it soon. Taking some time to polish the layout.

Matching button styles! (comparing to previous commit)

I might streamline this tool even more, by removing the
"Press Spacebar" / "Tap here" button, as there is a new main element now, that is the hex color value.
These call-to-action buttons would be replaced with text / tooltip-styled elements.

Thanks for reading!
